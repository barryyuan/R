1. Suppose you track your commute times for two weeks (10 days) and you find the following times in minutes
17 16 20 24 22 15 21 15 17 22
a.)	Enter this into R. Use the function max to find the longest commute time, the function mean to find the average and the function min to find the minimum.
x=c(17, 16, 20, 24, 22, 15, 21, 15, 17, 22) #input data
max(x)
mean(x)
min(x)
 

b.)	If the 24 was a mistake. It should have been 18. How can you fix this? Do so, and then find the new average.
x[x==24]=18
x
mean(x)
 

c.)	How many times was your commute 20 minutes or more? Answer this with R.
sum(x>=20) # if the question based on question b,the result is 4.
 

d.) What percent of your commutes are less than 17 minutes? How can you answer this with R?
prob=sum(x<17)/length(x) #length(x),the total number
prob
 
2. The volume of a sphere of radius r is given by  . For spheres having radius 3, 4, 5, …, 20 find the corresponding volumes and print the results out. Construct a data frame with columns radius and volume.
radius=3:20
volume=4/3*pi*radius^3  #change the number 3/4 to 4/3
volume #output the volume

data.frame(radius,volume)
 

3. For the data frame ais in DAAG package，show the number of males and females for each different sport. In which sports is there a large imbalance (e.g. by a factor of more than 2:1) in the numbers of the two sexes?
(Hint: you may need to use install.packages("DAAG") and library(DAAG))
install.packages("DAAG")
library(DAAG)
head(ais) #check the input number
str(ais)  #check the input number format
attach(ais)
 

#a,

nums=table(sport,sex)
nums
 

#b,

rownames(nums)[nums[,1]/nums[,2]>2|nums[,1]/nums[,2]<1/2]
   #find the imbalance columns
 


4. Create a matrix with 5 rows and 4 columns. Its elements are selected from 1:100 randomly with replacement. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of each column.   
A<-matrix(sample(1:100,20,replace=T),nrow=5,ncol=4)
apply(A,2,mean) #column means
apply(A,2,sd) #column standard deviations
 
5. Suppose
 
 
a<-c(1,5,-2,1,2,-1,3,6,-3)
A<-matrix(a,ncol=3,nrow=3)
A%*%A%*%A
 

#b,

A[,3]=A[,2]+A[,3]
A
 

6. Solve the following system of linear equations in five unknowns
 
by considering an appropriate matrix equation Ax = y.
a<-c(1,2,3,4,5,2,1,2,3,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,3,2,1,2,5,4,3,2,1)
A<-matrix(a,ncol=5)
A

y<-c(7,-1,-3,5,17)
x<-solve(A)%*%y
x
 
7. Create a 6 × 10 matrix of random integers chosen from 1, 2,… , 10 by executing the following line of code:
aMat <- matrix( sample(1:10, size=60, replace=T), nr=6)
(a)	Find the number of entries in each row which are greater than 4.
aMat = matrix( sample(1:10, size=60, replace=T), nr=6)
aMat# show the matrix
apply(aMat>4,1,sum)  
(b)	Which rows contain exactly two occurrences of the number seven?
which( apply(aMat,1,function(x){sum(x==7)==2}) )
 
(c)	Find those pairs of columns whose total (over both columns) is greater than 75. The answer should be a matrix with two columns; so, for example, the row (1, 2) in the output matrix means that the sum of columns 1 and 2 in the original matrix is greater than 75. Repeating a column is not permitted. 
acsum <- apply(aMat,2,sum)
acc=vector()
for (i in 1:9)
for (j in (i+1):10)
{ if(acsum[i]+acsum[j]>75)
acc=c(acc,c(i,j))
}
acc=matrix(acc,ncol=2,byrow=T)
acc
 
8. Physical fitness testing is an important aspect of athletic training. A common measure of the magnitude of cardiovascular fitness is the maximum volume of oxygen uptake during a strenuous exercise. A study was conducted on 24 middle-aged men to study the influence of the time that it takes to complete a 2-mile run. The oxygen uptake measure was accomplished with standard laboratory methods as the subjects performed on a motor driven treadmill.
The data are as follows:
 

Write R codes for the following questions and show the R outputs. (Remarks: Write your own R codes based on the formula given in the class of regression analysis. Don't use the existing regression analysis function 'lm()' in R.)

(a)	Input the data into R.
a=read.csv(file.choose(),header=T) #select the file,named'assighment 1 data'
head(a) #check the number
dim(a) 
str(a)  #check the type
names(a) #in order to copy the variables` name 
attach(a)
